# AWS-Based-NRT-Public-Transport-Monitoring-System

## Introduction
Public transport systems increasingly rely on near real-time data to improve service reliability and provide passengers with accurate transport arriving times and schedule information to improve commute efficiency. The General Transit Feed Specification Real-Time (GTFS-RT)  API allows transit agencies to share real-time updates such as vehicle locations, trip and timing changes, or any alerts on services. This project focuses on designing and deploying a distributed, cloud-based monitoring system that leverages GTFS near real time feeds at a large scale and processes the data in near real-time using AWS managed services.
